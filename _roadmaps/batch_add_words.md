Absolutely — you can modify the script to work in a "check mode" where it **only shows what would be added** without saving anything to the database.

Here’s the updated version:

---

### ✅ Check Mode Script (does NOT save to DB)
```python
import json
from myapp.models import Word  # Replace `myapp` with your app name

# Load the JSON file
with open('words.json', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    words = json.load(f)

new_entries = []

for entry in words:
    french = entry['french'].strip()
    korean = entry['korean'].strip()
    
    # Check if the (french, korean) pair already exists
    exists = Word.objects.filter(french=french, korean=korean).exists()
    
    if not exists:
        new_entries.append((french, korean))

# Print the results
print(f"\n🔍 Check Mode: {len(new_entries)} new word(s) would be added.\n")
for i, (french, korean) in enumerate(new_entries, 1):
    print(f"{i}. French: '{french}' → Korean: '{korean}'")
```

---

### 🧪 Example Output
```
🔍 Check Mode: 2 new word(s) would be added.

1. French: 'bonjour' → Korean: '안녕하세요'
2. French: 'fromage' → Korean: '치즈'
```

---

Let me know if you want:
- A diff view that shows which French words map to the same Korean one,
- Or a flag/argument to toggle between "check" and "apply" mode.
