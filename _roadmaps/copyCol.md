Yes, absolutely â€” that's the **safe and Django-friendly way** to rename a column or transition to new ones like `FR`, `EN`, `KR`. Hereâ€™s how to do it step-by-step without losing data:

---

## âœ… Let's say you're renaming `french â†’ FR` in your `Word` model.

### Step 1: Add the new field

Update your model:

```python
class Word(models.Model):
    french = models.CharField(max_length=100)  # existing field
    FR = models.CharField(max_length=100, blank=True, null=True)  # new field
```

Then:

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

---

### Step 2: Copy data from `french` to `FR`

Create a **data migration** (manual migration that modifies database data):

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations yourapp --empty --name copy_french_to_fr
```

Edit the migration file Django creates (inside `yourapp/migrations/XXXX_copy_french_to_fr.py`):

```python
from django.db import migrations

def copy_french_to_fr(apps, schema_editor):
    Word = apps.get_model('yourapp', 'Word')
    for word in Word.objects.all():
        word.FR = word.french
        word.save()

class Migration(migrations.Migration):

    dependencies = [
        ('yourapp', 'XXXX_previous_migration'),
    ]

    operations = [
        migrations.RunPython(copy_french_to_fr),
    ]
```

Then run:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

---

### Step 3: Remove the old field (`french`)

Now that data is copied, update your model again:

```python
class Word(models.Model):
    FR = models.CharField(max_length=100)
```

And run:

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

âœ… Done! You safely renamed the field *without losing any data*.

### ðŸ”’ Tip: Back up first

Before destructive changes (like dropping a column), especially in production:
- Make a backup of your DB
- Or export your model data using `dumpdata`

### ðŸš€ Want a shortcut?

You can also keep both temporarily in your model and override `save()` to keep them in sync until you're confident itâ€™s safe to delete one. Let me know if thatâ€™s your vibe and Iâ€™ll show you how.
