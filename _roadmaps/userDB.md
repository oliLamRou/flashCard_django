Yes! If you're using Django's built-in authentication (`django.contrib.auth`), it **already provides a User model** with a database table. You donâ€™t need to create a separate user tableâ€”just link your `Learn` model to Djangoâ€™s `User`.  

---

### **Your Final Model Structure**
Based on your needs (User, Word, Score tracking), your structure should look like this:

```python
from django.db import models
from django.contrib.auth.models import User  # Django's built-in User model

class Word(models.Model):
    text = models.CharField(max_length=255, unique=True)  # Ensures no duplicate words

class Learn(models.Model):  # The linking table
    user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)  # Links to Django's User model
    word = models.ForeignKey(Word, on_delete=models.CASCADE)  # Links to a Word
    score = models.IntegerField(default=0)  # Tracks learning progress
    learned_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)  # Timestamp of learning

    class Meta:
        unique_together = ('user', 'word')  # Prevents duplicate entries for same user & word

```

---

### **How Django Handles the User Model**
1. When you run `python manage.py migrate`, Django **automatically creates a user table** in your database.
2. You can create users using:
   - Django Admin (`/admin/`)
   - The built-in User model (`User.objects.create_user()`)
   - Django's authentication views (signup/login)
   
3. You can access a logged-in user in your views using `request.user`.

### **Querying the Data**
#### Get all words a user has learned:
```python
learned_words = Word.objects.filter(learn__user=request.user)
```

#### Get all users who learned a specific word:
```python
users = User.objects.filter(learn__word=some_word)
```

#### Update a user's learning progress:
```python
learn_entry, created = Learn.objects.get_or_create(user=request.user, word=some_word)
learn_entry.score += 1
learn_entry.save()
```

### **Next Steps**
- If you haven't set up authentication yet, you can enable it with Djangoâ€™s `django.contrib.auth` system.
- If you need custom user fields later, you can **extend Django's User model** instead of making a new one.
