# HTTP Status Codes Cheatsheet for Frontend-Backend Authentication

## Success Codes (2xx)
- **200 OK**: Request succeeded. Use for successful GET requests and general success.
- **201 Created**: Resource successfully created. Use after POST requests that create new resources.
- **204 No Content**: Request succeeded but no content returned. Common for DELETE operations.

## Redirection Codes (3xx)
- **301 Moved Permanently**: Resource has been permanently moved to a new URL.
- **302 Found**: Resource temporarily moved to a different URL.
- **304 Not Modified**: Resource hasn't changed since last request (used with conditional GET).

## Client Error Codes (4xx)
- **400 Bad Request**: Server cannot process the request due to client error (malformed request).
- **401 Unauthorized**: Authentication required or failed. User is not authenticated.
- **403 Forbidden**: Server refuses to fulfill request despite authentication. User lacks permissions.
- **404 Not Found**: Requested resource could not be found.
- **405 Method Not Allowed**: HTTP method not allowed for this resource.
- **409 Conflict**: Request conflicts with the current state of the resource.
- **422 Unprocessable Entity**: Request was well-formed but contains semantic errors (validation failed).
- **429 Too Many Requests**: User has sent too many requests in a given time (rate limiting).

## Server Error Codes (5xx)
- **500 Internal Server Error**: Generic server error message.
- **502 Bad Gateway**: Server acting as gateway received invalid response from upstream server.
- **503 Service Unavailable**: Server is temporarily unavailable (overloaded or down for maintenance).
- **504 Gateway Timeout**: Server acting as gateway did not receive timely response from upstream server.

## Authentication-Specific Handling in Frontend

### Common Authentication Patterns
1. **Login**:
   - Success (200): Store user data, redirect to protected route
   - Failure (401): Show login error message

2. **Protected Routes**:
   - Success (200): Display requested data/page
   - Unauthorized (401): Redirect to login page
   - Forbidden (403): Show "insufficient permissions" message

3. **Token/Session Expired**:
   - When any request returns 401: Redirect to login or attempt token refresh

### Example Svelte Request Handler
```javascript
async function apiRequest(endpoint, options = {}) {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/${endpoint}`, {
      ...options,
      credentials: 'include',
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        ...options.headers
      }
    });
    
    // Handle response based on status
    switch (response.status) {
      case 200:
      case 201:
        return await response.json();
      case 204:
        return null;
      case 401:
        // Redirect to login
        window.location.href = '/login';
        break;
      case 403:
        // Show permission denied
        throw new Error('You do not have permission to access this resource');
      case 404:
        throw new Error('Resource not found');
      case 422:
        // Validation errors
        const errors = await response.json();
        throw new Error(`Validation failed: ${JSON.stringify(errors)}`);
      case 429:
        throw new Error('Rate limit exceeded. Please try again later.');
      case 500:
      case 502:
      case 503:
      case 504:
        throw new Error('Server error. Please try again later.');
      default:
        throw new Error(`Unexpected status code: ${response.status}`);
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('API request failed:', error);
    throw error;
  }
}
```
