### Goal
Gain full-stack development skills while creating a tool to help myself learn Korean. While this app is currently a simple flashcard app, it gives me a lot of ideas and insights into building and deploying a real-world web app.

### Main Technology
-> Backend: Python, Django, PostgreSQL  
-> Frontend: HTML, JS, Svelte, SvelteKit  
-> Deployment: Vercel, Render, Shell, YAML

You can, at your own risk, create an account and try the app [here](https://flash-card-django.vercel.app/auth/register).
